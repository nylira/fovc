Besides the initial development of the Essential Cosmos Software and Services, Cosmos Inc has no further obligations with regards to the Cosmos Ecosystem, Cosmos Hub, or derivatives (forks) of the Cosmos Hub, but instead is a general participant in the network.</p> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">Cosmos Ecosystem</strong>: Includes the Cosmos Network and other software and services, including validator and client software.</p> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">Cosmos Hub</strong>: An Cosmos hub is itself a blockchain, or zone, that connects to many other zones. The hub facilitates token movement between zones. The Cosmos Hub will be the first hub, and the first zone.</p> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">Cosmos Hub Block Reward</strong>: The blockchain will reward the Validators and Delegators in proportion to their bonded atoms, and afterwards account for any commissions that delegators pay to delegate validators. The reward will consist of two categories -- transaction fees, and inflationary atoms. The transction fees will be any fee collected by a validator. In addition, there will be inflationary atoms at a rate of 1/3 of the total number of atoms per year. Cosmos holders who do not put their atoms at stake by being a validator or delegating to a validator will not receive any of the Cosmos Hub Block Rewards.</p> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">Cosmos Network</strong>: Includes the Cosmos Hub and all connected zones.</p> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">Crowdfund</strong>: An atom token crowdfund event that happens during a period of 42 days. There will be a website where those who wish to purchase atoms can sign up The crowdfund proceeds will be used to complete the Essential Cosmos Software and Services, starting with the release of TendermintCore. </p> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">Delegator</strong>: An atom holder who puts their atoms at stake by delegating its validating power and voting power to a validator. They are still responsible for voting on proposals during the vesting period. If they don\'t vote they will be penalized, but they will inherit the vote of the delegated validator.</p> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">Early Funders</strong>: The Early Funders are qualified investors who purchase 5% of the Genesis atoms prior to the crowdfund. The majority of the proceeds from the early funding will go toward legal and PR fees, and also help pay salary for Cosmos Inc until the crowdfunding is complete.</p> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">Validator</strong>: Validators are full nodes of a Cosmos zone that have the responsibility of committing blocks in that zone. The Cosmos Hub will start with 100 validator spots. Due to the limited number of validator spots, not everyone who has atoms can be a validator. Instead, everyone else can bond atoms and delegate their consensus voting power to any of the 100 validators. Before Genesis, the Cosmos Crowdfund funders will play the Delegation Game to determine the top 100 bonded delegates who will become the genesis validators.</p> <h3 id=essential-cosmos-software-and-services _v-0b297907="">Essential Cosmos Software and Services</h3> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">TendermintCore</strong></p> <ul _v-0b297907=""> <li _v-0b297907=""><em _v-0b297907="">Alpha</em><ul _v-0b297907=""> <li _v-0b297907="">fix existing issues</li> <li _v-0b297907="">mempool optimization</li> <li _v-0b297907="">peer exchange handler</li> <li _v-0b297907="">validator set changes</li> <li _v-0b297907="">fork detection and handling</li> </ul> </li> <li _v-0b297907=""><em _v-0b297907="">Beta</em><ul _v-0b297907=""> <li _v-0b297907="">tendermint consensus v2</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">Cosmos Hub</strong></p> <ul _v-0b297907=""> <li _v-0b297907=""><em _v-0b297907="">Alpha</em><ul _v-0b297907=""> <li _v-0b297907="">multiasset accounts</li> <li _v-0b297907="">atom staking with delegation</li> <li _v-0b297907="">governance</li> <li _v-0b297907="">basic wallet client</li> </ul> </li> <li _v-0b297907=""><em _v-0b297907="">Beta</em><ul _v-0b297907=""> <li _v-0b297907="">zone support<ul _v-0b297907=""> <li _v-0b297907="">exchange zone</li> <li _v-0b297907="">ethereum zone</li> <li _v-0b297907="">import crypto distributions</li> </ul> </li> <li _v-0b297907="">Cosmos network explorer client</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p _v-0b297907=""><strong _v-0b297907="">Other</strong></p> <ul _v-0b297907=""> <li _v-0b297907="">hardware wallet integration <em _v-0b297907="">with sufficient funding</em></li> <li _v-0b297907="">Ethereum peg <em _v-0b297907="">with sufficient funding</em></li> <li _v-0b297907="">Bitcoin peg <em _v-0b297907="">with partner, if possible</em></li> </ul> <h2 id=funding _v-0b297907="">Funding</h2> <p _v-0b297907="">Funds will be raised by Cosmos Inc in 2 phases.</p> <h3 id=phase-0-the-prefund _v-0b297907="">Phase 0: the Prefund</h3> <p _v-0b297907="">During the Prefund, 5% of future Genesis atoms will be sold to qualified investors with a cap and/or discount.

There are many ways to handle sharding in SQL databases, but sharding for blockchains is an emerging field. The closest thing we have are the altcoins ecosystem, but this isn\'t very good because all the altcoins are their own silos with no good way to interoperate except via centralized exchanges, or tricks like hashlocked transactions (like the Lightning Network), which have their own benefits and drawbacks.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">How does Cosmos do sharding?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">Cosmos implements sharding using zones. It\'s a sharding solution that preserves the sovereignty of the shard as a self-governing and self-validating system. The Cosmos Hub doesn\'t care about the internal state of an Cosmos zone -- rather, all that matters to the Cosmos Hub is what the zone explicitly communicates to the Cosmos Hub via IBC packets.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">What\'s an IBC packet?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">IBC packets are packets of data that one blockchain wishes to send to another blockchain. But instead of literally sending a packet of bytes via the TCP/IP or UDP/IP protocol (which is designed for singular, physical, machines), IBC packets require cryptographic proof-of-existence. Since no single node or validator has the authority to speak on behalf of the entire blockchain, and, since we don\'t want to rely on the integrity of the IP internet infrastructure, instead we rely on a cryptographic proof of a blockchain hash commit (+2/3 of signatures for that blockchain hash) along with a Merkle-proof from the aforementioned blockhash to a packet in the blockchain\'s "application state", which proves that the blockchain validators agreed to publish this packet of information. So, anyone who sees an IBC packet (regardless of the source of this data) can verify its integrity.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">Isn\'t this just sidechains, like what Blockstream proposed?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">Yes. Exactly. Except in Cosmos, the hubs and zones are all powered by Tendermint consensus. IBC on Tendermint is great because of all the reasons why light-client payment verification is great as compared to proof-of-work -- superior speed, no need to download all the block headers, 1-block finality, and security via collateral. So Cosmos is a bit like Blockstream\'s sidechains proposal, except with the Cosmos Hub at the center instead of Bitcoin, which makes everything faster and simpler, and arguably more secure. Also the fact that the Cosmos Hub is a multiasset blockchain is a big advantage.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">How does Cosmos compare to Ethereum sharding?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">Vitalik is working on sharding solutions for Ethereum, but the solutions I\'ve seen assume that all the shards are running the same VM. The biggest difference between what Vitalik\'s latest sharding design and Cosmos is that the Cosmos Hub lets you plug in any zone, even for entirely different VMs or zones with no VMs at all (like Bitcoind). This works because the Cosmos Hub is about preserving the total number of tokens across zones/shards, whereas Vitalik\'s scaling solution is about sharding the general Ethereum state machine state. The zones of the Cosmos Hub don\'t care that other zones fail or crash, as long as the Cosmos Hub continues to function and preserves the total number of tokens across all the zones. Vitalik is trying to create a sharding solution where none of the shards may fail, because the internal state of those shards can mean anything at all. Vitalik is trying to solve a much more difficult problem. If we do our job right, we will be able to implement whatever he comes up within Cosmos.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">Why are shards called zones?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">Shards are called zones in Cosmos because they really are like sovereign economic zones. We\'ve seen a taste of blockchain governance with the Ethereum hard-fork following TheDAO hack. In Cosmos, all zones are sovereign and can construct their own governance policies, and yet they can all interoperate on the Cosmos Hub. That\'s the benefit of the IBC abstraction, that it\'s about accountable and cryptographicaly verifiable communication.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">How does one exchange currencies in this system?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">For tokens outside the Cosmos system, they can only be introduced via pegged derivatives (akin to what Blockstream\'s sidechains paper was suggesting). I suppose you could also use other means to track the value of some token inside the Cosmos network by involving prediction markets or betting, but I\'m not an expert on those. They can be supported too by other zones, but I won\'t go into them here.</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">In the Cosmos Hub, pegs will be tied to a specific zone; that is, a zone and its validator sets are expected to also be involved in a m-of-n contract on the target chain, like Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p> <pre _v-87548bb0=""><code _v-87548bb0="">           _ peg smart contract\n          /\n  [  Ethereum  ] &lt;--&gt; [ EtherCosmos Peg Zone ] &lt;-IBC-&gt; [  Cosmos Hub  ] &lt;-IBC-&gt; (Bitcoin) [ PoW/Casper ]\n                      [      Tendermint      ]         [  Tendermint  ] &lt;-IBC-&gt; (exchange)\n</code></pre><p _v-87548bb0="">Once the tokens are in the hub, its must easier to exchange currencies. Either trade with another account directly in the Cosmos Hub (a Send transaction with two inputs and two outputs, with 2 different assets, swapped). But this requires both parties to the trade to be online. Instead, you can send your tokens to an exchange zone, to take advantage of an order-book.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">So can I trade BTC for ETH using Cosmos?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">You can, if you trust the respective Ethereum and Bitcoin peg zones. If alternatives of Ethereum and Bitcoin (ie. same codebase, different network) launch on Cosmos, you can trade those directly.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">Does Cosmos involve escrow?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">Not really, though the hub may be thought of as an escrow agent mediating between two zones, but that\'s of course the point. However, the pegs in peg-zones may well utilize escrow to allow, for instance, BTC to move into a zone.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">How does one switch blockchains in this system?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">The zone is responsible for committing an IBC packet with outbound coins for another zone. Zones can do whatever they want, so it\'s really up to the logic of the zone, as well as the client. Ideally there will be a standard specification for constructing a transaction to move funds from one zone to another. So an EVM zone should be implemented such that it can process this universal transaction format that lets any simple user account send funds to another zone via the Cosmos Hub (or any other hub). This may be something to be defined as an IETF or W3C specification, but it\'s a bit too early for that, so we should forge ahead and document the spec for everyone to see.</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">There should be some specification for defining:</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0="">the destination zone</li> <li _v-87548bb0="">the intermediary zones (typically the Cosmos Hub)</li> <li _v-87548bb0="">the assets and quantity</li> <li _v-87548bb0="">the destination account or smart contract</li> <li _v-87548bb0="">any other information</li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">These are specified <a href=https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md#ibcpackettx _v-87548bb0="">here</a>.</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">There will also be way to navigate these zones, whereby nodes or validators of a zone can publish their IP endpoints or whatnot, voluntarily. So zone discovery is a thing, but mostly it\'s up to the end-client software to understand this plumbing. End-users shouldn\'t know all of the details except a few rules for safety, like "don\'t send money to zones you don\'t know".</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">Is consensus configurable? When I am switching between blockchains won\'t my consensus be different in different scenarios?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">We can accomodate other PoS consensus mechanisms as long as they have a very clean and consise light-client verification protocol. Or, even Tendermint might upgrade to support additional features. It will be up to the Cosmos Foundation and the Cosmos governance to decide whether to support them. It isn\'t necessary if there can be adapter zones. That\'s what a Bitcoin peg zone is -- an adapter zone to sit between PoW and Tendermint.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">What is the maximum number of nodes in Cosmos? Does each zone or hub have their own nodes?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">Yes. Each zone has its own nodes, we don\'t re-use public keys (yet, though we could in the future). Different atoms bonded in each zone, but all the same atom token.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">Do the validatiors that are chosen, validate transactions for every zone and Hub?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">No. Validators for a zone only validate transactions for their zone.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">The whitepaper states "Zones communicate with one another through a hub, primarily in the form of assymetric transfer of some set of tokens from one zone to another." Can you talk about what exactly the asymmetric transfer is?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">It\'s maybe not the best term, but we coined it to refer to the kind of inter-zone token transfer that happens in the Cosmos Hub. The transfer of tokens was not via any bidirectional or bilateral exchange mechanism, or even through a peg. It\'s as if the token moved from one zone to another. The trick is that there is a common crypto "depository" -- the Cosmos Hub.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">According to the whitepaper: "Cosmos reflects this position in that it makes no distinction between hubs - there is no "top" hub, and the most popular or successful hub is a matter of adoption by zones. " In your view what will make hubs more successful and what will make them unsuccessful?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">There will be different features... speed (limiting to 100 validators), flexibility (e.g. if implemented on the EVM), or perhaps nation-state sponsorship or better integration with the legal system (via traditional banking partners), etc. One could also imagine a much slower, but more distributed "slow hub", or much faster but less decentralized "high-frequency hubs".</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">What will be the process for abandoning validators that misbehave?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">If a validator misbehaves on its own by double-signing at the same height &amp; round, then the evidence is very short and simple -- it\'s just the two conflicting votes. This evidence can be included in the the CosmosHub as a Slash transaction, and the validator will immediately become inactive and slashed after the Slash transaction gets committed.</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">If there is a zone fork, either of the Cosmos Hub or any of the zones, the two conflicting commits also constitute evidence. This is a much more complicated data structure. It is guaranteed to slash at least 1/3 of the validators\' atoms for that zone.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">Can delegators also be validators? Or are delegators never validators?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">Delegators are never validators. If someone who operates validator nodes wishes to delegate, they need to do so with their free and unbonded atoms.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">"Validators\' voting powers are determined at genesis, or is changed deterministically by the blockchain, depending on the application." Any idea what shape this will take initially what are you thinking for voting powers?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">(Are these two separate questions? What do you mean "what are you thinking for voting powers?")</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">I have no idea what shape this will take. We need to reach out to a wide audience for the crowdfund, and that will help us get a better distribution, even if we don\'t know exactly who owns these tokens.</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">In some way it doesn\'t matter, because even if there are attacks and mishaps along the way, eventually through hard-forks the blockchain can purge the bad actors. It\'s antifragile.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">Can you give some details about what you took(derived) from the DLS consensus algorithm?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">The locking mechanism was something that I hadn\'t seen in other papers, like PBFT. There\'s an equivalence to PBFT\'s system, but the locking and unlocking mechanics in PBFT happen implicitly.</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">Increasing the length of time of a round to circumvent partial-synchrony is something that the early versions of Tendermint Consensus used. In the current version of Tendermint Consensus, which is more asynchronous, this "time delay" is limited to the timeout period after a 2/3 quorum of any votes for the same height &amp; round.</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">The 2/3 quorum of any votes to synchronize validators, a kind of virtual clock cycle, was also inspired by DLS\'s paper in the later sections (after section 5).</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">Why is Cosmos\'s governance better than any other options out there?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">One is, the stakeholders are well defined, as is the prior social contract. ETH had a hard time with the fork because they had to ask the ether holders as well as the miners, but the ether holders had no prior social contract or obligation to partake in governance, so no quorum could be reached in time. Asking the miners is necessary to ensure that the hard-fork will have support, but after a while they tend to simply follow the money and incentives.</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">Cosmos is different because instead of anonymous miners we have social contract bound validators and delegators who have stake, and, they have the obligation to partake in governance.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">What use cases do you think are most compelling in the future?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">Cosmos allows everyone to benefit from the network effect of various interoperable tokens and zones. For example, if anyone creates a peg zone or a new token type, all the other zones can use them if they support the new token type.</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">So, the Cosmos Hub has a particular use-case that isn\'t filled by anything today. The best use-case for Cosmos Zones are for any token-based blockchain that benefit from the new interoperability, speed, and scalability properties. It may be a kind of distributed exchange.</p> <ul _v-87548bb0=""> <li _v-87548bb0=""><strong _v-87548bb0="">Do you feel Cosmos and Interledger are complimentary or are you directly competing with it?</strong></li> </ul> <p _v-87548bb0="">They\'re more complementary than competing. For one, Interledger will be very useful for creating Cosmos zones that interface with the traditional financial system.</p> <p _v-87548bb0="">Interledger can also be used directly between blockchain zones. For this use-case, the Cosmos Hub may be a competitive option, as compared to other options for Interledger notary sets. The Cosmos Hub validators could also offer their services as an Interledger notary set.</p> </div> <section class=section-default _v-87548bb0=""><div class=section-container _v-87548bb0=""> <countdown _v-87548bb0=""></countdown> </div></section> ';

_v-d057093e="">The combined success of the open-source ecosystem, of decentralized file-sharing, and of public cryptocurrencies, has inspired an understanding that decentralized internet protocols can be used to radically improve socio-economic infrastructure. We have seen specialized blockchain applications like Bitcoin <a href=https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf _v-d057093e="">[1]</a> (a cryptocurrency), Zerocash <a href=http://zerocash-project.org/paper _v-d057093e="">[2]</a> (a cryptocurrency for privacy), and generalized smart contract platforms such as Ethereum <a href=https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper _v-d057093e="">[3]</a>, with countless distributed applications for the EVM such as Augur (a prediction market) and TheDAO <a href=https://download.slock.it/public/DAO/WhitePaper.pdf _v-d057093e="">[4]</a> (an investment club).</p> <p _v-d057093e="">To date, however, these blockchains have suffered from a number of drawbacks, including their gross energy inefficiency, poor or limited performance, and immature governance mechanisms. A number of proposals have been made to scale Bitcoin\'s transaction throughput such as Segregated-Witness <a href=https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki _v-d057093e="">[5]</a> and BitcoinNG <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.02037v2.pdf _v-d057093e="">[6]</a>, but these are vertical scaling solutions that remain limited by the capacity of a single physical machine, lest we sacrifice the property of complete auditability. The Lightning Network <a href=https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper-DRAFT-0.5.pdf _v-d057093e="">[7]</a> can help scale Bitcoin transaction volume by leaving some transactions off the ledger completely and is well suited for micropayments and privacy preserving payment rails, but may not be suitable for more generalized scaling needs.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">An ideal solution would be one that allows multiple parallel blockchains to interoperate while retaining their security properties, but this has proven difficult, if not impossible, with proof-of-work. Merged-mining, for instance, allows the work done to secure a parent chain to be re-used on a child chain, but transactions still must be validated, in order, by each node, and a merge-mined blockchain is vulnerable to attack if a majority of the hashing power on the parent is not actively merge-mining the child. An academic review of <a href=http://vukolic.com/iNetSec_2015.pdf _v-d057093e="">alternative blockchain network architectures</a> is provided for additional context, and we provide more summaries of some proposals and their drawbacks in <a href=#related-work _v-d057093e="">Related Work</a>.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Here we present Cosmos, a novel blockchain network architecture that addresses all of these problems. Cosmos is a network of many independent blockchains, called zones. The zones are powered by Tendermint Core <a href=https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki _v-d057093e="">[8]</a>, which provides a high-performance, consistent, secure <a href=http://tendermint.com/blog/tendermint-vs-pbft/ _v-d057093e="">PBFT-like</a> consensus engine, where strict <a href=#fork-accountability _v-d057093e="">fork-accountability</a> guarantees hold over the behaviour of malicious actors. Tendermint Core\'s BFT consensus algorithm is well suited for scaling public proof-of-stake blockchains.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The first zone on Cosmos is called the Cosmos Hub. The Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset proof-of-stake cryptocurrency with a simple governance mechanism enabling the network to adapt and upgrade. In addition, the Cosmos Hub can be extended by connecting other zones.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The hub and zones of the Cosmos network communicate with each other via an inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol, a kind of virtual UDP or TCP for blockchains. Tokens can be transferred from one zone to another, securely and quickly, without the need for exchange liquidity between zones. Instead, all inter-zone token transfers go through the Cosmos Hub, which keeps track of the total amount of tokens held by each zone. The hub isolates each zone from the failure of other zones. Since anyone can connect a new zone to the Cosmos Hub, zones allow for future-compatibility with new blockchain innovations.</p> <h2 id=tendermint _v-d057093e="">Tendermint</h2> <p _v-d057093e="">In this section we describe the Tendermint consensus protocol and the interface used to build applications with it. For more details, see the <a href=#appendix _v-d057093e="">appendix</a>.</p> <h3 id=validators _v-d057093e="">Validators</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">In classical Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) algorithms, each node has the same weight. In Tendermint, nodes have a non-negative amount of <em _v-d057093e="">voting power</em>, and nodes that have positive voting power are called <em _v-d057093e="">validators</em>. Validators participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting cryptographic signatures, or <em _v-d057093e="">votes</em>, to agree upon the next block.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Validators\' voting powers are determined at genesis, or is changed deterministically by the blockchain, depending on the application. For example, in a proof-of-stake application such as the Cosmos Hub, the voting power may be determined by the amount of staking tokens bonded as collateral.</p> <p _v-d057093e=""><em _v-d057093e="">NOTE: Fractions like ⅔ and ⅓ refer to fractions of the total voting power, never the total number of validators, unless all the validators have equal weight.</em> <em _v-d057093e="">NOTE: +⅔ means "more than ⅔", while ⅓+ means "⅓ or more".</em></p> <h3 id=consensus _v-d057093e="">Consensus</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">Tendermint is a partially synchronous BFT consensus protocol derived from the DLS consensus algorithm <a href=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf _v-d057093e="">[20]</a>. Tendermint is notable for its simplicity, performance, and <a href=#fork-accountability _v-d057093e="">fork-accountability</a>. The protocol requires a fixed, known set of validators, where each validator is identified by its public key. Validators attempt to come to consensus on one block at a time, where a block is a list of transactions. Consensus on a block proceeds in rounds. Each round has a round-leader, or proposer, who proposes a block. The validators then vote, in stages, on whether or not to accept the proposed block or move on to the next round. The proposer for a round is chosen deterministically from the ordered list of validators, in proportion to their voting power.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The full details of the protocol are described <a href=https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Byzantine-Consensus-Algorithm _v-d057093e="">here</a>.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Tendermint’s security derives from its use of optimal Byzantine fault-tolerance via super-majority (+⅔) voting and a locking mechanism. Together, they ensure that:</p> <ul _v-d057093e=""> <li _v-d057093e="">⅓+ voting power must be Byzantine to cause a violation of safety, where more than two values are committed. </li> <li _v-d057093e="">if ever any set of validators succeeds in violating safety, or even attempts to do so, they can be identified by the protocol. This includes both voting for conflicting blocks and broadcasting unjustified votes.</li> </ul> <p _v-d057093e="">Despite its strong guarantees, Tendermint provides exceptional performance. In benchmarks of 64 nodes distributed across 7 datacenters on 5 continents, on commodity cloud instances, Tendermint consensus can process thousands of transactions per second, with commit latencies on the order of one or two seconds. Notably, performance of well over a thousand transactions per second is maintained even in harsh adversarial conditions, with validators crashing or broadcasting maliciously crafted votes. See figure below for details.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">![Figure of Tendermint throughput performance] (<a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnuclear/atom-whitepaper/master/images/tendermint_throughput_blocksize.png _v-d057093e="">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnuclear/atom-whitepaper/master/images/tendermint_throughput_blocksize.png</a>)</p> <h3 id=light-clients _v-d057093e="">Light Clients</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">A major benefit of Tendermint\'s consensus algorithm is simplified light client security, making it an ideal candidate for mobile and internet-of-things use cases. While a Bitcoin light client must sync chains of block headers and find the one with the most proof of work, Tendermint light clients need only to keep up with changes to the validator set, and then simply verify the +⅔ PreCommits in the latest block to determine the latest state.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Succinct light client proofs also enable <a href=#inter-blockchain-communication-ibc _v-d057093e="">inter-blockchain communication</a>.</p> <h3 id=preventing-attacks _v-d057093e="">Preventing Attacks</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">Tendermint has various protective measures for preventing certain notable attacks, like <a href=#preventing-long-range-attacks _v-d057093e="">long-range-nothing-at-stake double spends</a> and <a href=#overcoming-forks-and-censorship-attacks _v-d057093e="">censorship</a>. These are discussed more fully in the <a href=#appendix _v-d057093e="">appendix</a>.</p> <h3 id=tmsp _v-d057093e="">TMSP</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">The Tendermint consensus algorithm is implemented in a program called Tendermint Core. Tendermint Core is an application-agnostic "consensus engine" that can turn any deterministic blackbox application into a distributedly replicated blockchain. As the Apache Web Server or Nginx connects to the Wordpress application via CGI or FastCGI, Tendermint Core connects to blockchain applications via the Tendermint Socket Protocol (TMSP) <a href=https://github.com/tendermint/tmsp _v-d057093e="">[17]</a>. Thus, TMSP allows for blockchain applications to be programmed in any language, not just the programming language that the consensus engine is written in. Additionally, TMSP makes it possible to easily swap out the consensus layer of any existing blockchain stack.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">We draw an analogy with a well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency blockchain where each node maintains a fully audited Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) database. If one wanted to create a Bitcoin-like system on top of TMSP, Tendermint Core would be responsible for</p> <ul _v-d057093e=""> <li _v-d057093e="">Sharing blocks and transactions between nodes</li> <li _v-d057093e="">Establishing a canonical/immutable order of transactions (the blockchain)</li> </ul> <p _v-d057093e="">Meanwhile, the TMSP application would be responsible for</p> <ul _v-d057093e=""> <li _v-d057093e="">Maintaining the UTXO database</li> <li _v-d057093e="">Validating cryptographic signatures of transactions</li> <li _v-d057093e="">Preventing transactions from spending non-existent transactions</li> <li _v-d057093e="">Allowing clients to query the UTXO database.</li> </ul> <p _v-d057093e="">Tendermint is able to decompose the blockchain design by offering a very simple API between the application process and consensus process.</p> <h2 id=cosmos-overview _v-d057093e="">Cosmos Overview</h2> <p _v-d057093e="">Cosmos is a network of independent parallel blockchains that are each powered by classical BFT consensus algorithms like Tendermint <a href=http://github.com/tendermint/tendermint _v-d057093e="">1</a>.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The first blockchain in this network will be the Cosmos Hub. The Cosomos Hub connects to many other blockchains (or <em _v-d057093e="">zones</em>) via a novel inter-blockchain communication protocol. The Cosmos Hub tracks numerous token types, and keeps record of the total number of tokens in each connected zone. Tokens can be transferred from one zone to another, securely and quickly, without the need for a liquid exchange between zones, because all inter-zone coin transfers go through the Cosmos Hub.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">This architecture solves so many problems that the blockchain space faces today, including application interoperability, scalability, and seamless upgradability. For example, zones derived from Bitcoind, Go-Ethereum, CryptoNote, ZCash, or any blockchain system can be plugged into the Cosmos Hub. These zones allow Cosmos to scale infinitely to meet global transaction demand. And, zones are a great fit for a distributed exchange, which will be supported as well.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Cosmos is not just a single distributed ledger, and the Cosmos Hub isn\'t a walled garden or the center of its universe. We are designing a protocol for an open network of distributed legers that can serve as a new foundation for our future financial systems, based on principles of cryptography, sound economics, consensus theory, transparency, and accountability.</p> <h3 id=tendermint-bft-dpos _v-d057093e="">Tendermint-BFT DPoS</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">The Cosmos Hub is the first public blockchain in the Cosmos Network powered by Tendermint\'s BFT consensus algorithm. The Tendermint open-source project was born in 2014 to address the speed, scalability, and environmental issues of Bitcoin\'s proof-of-work consensus algorithm. By utilizing and improving upon proven BFT algorithms developed at MIT in 1988, the Tendermint team was first to conceptually demonstrate a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency that addresses the nothing-at-stake problem suffered by first-gen proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies such as NXT and BitShares.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Today, practically all Bitcoin mobile wallets use trusted servers to provide them with transaction verification. This is because proof-of-work requires waiting for many confirmations before a transaction can be considered irreversibly committed. Double-spend attacks have already been demonstrated on services like CoinBase.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Unlike other blockchain consensus systems, Tendermint offers instant and provably-secure mobile-client payment verification. Since the Tendermint is designed not to fork at all, mobile wallets can receive instant transaction confirmation, finally making trustless and practical payments a reality on your smartphone. This has significant ramifications for IoT applications as well.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Validators in Cosmos (who have a similar role to Bitcoin miners but instead use cryptographic signatures to vote) are meant to be secure, dedicated machines that are responsible for committing blocks. Non-validators can delegate their staking tokens (called "atoms") to any validator to earn a portion of block fees and atom rewards, but incur the risk of getting punished (slashed) if the delegate validator gets hacked or violates the protocol. The proven safety guarantees of Tendermint BFT consensus, and the collateral deposit of stakeholders (of validators and delegators) provide provable, quantifiable security for nodes and even light clients.</p> <h3 id=governance _v-d057093e="">Governance</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">Distributed public ledgers should have a constitution and a governance system. Bitcoin relies on the Bitcoin Foundation (to some degree) and mining to coordinate upgrades, but this is a slow process. Ethereum split into ETH and ETC after the hard-fork to address TheDAO hack, largely because there was no prior social contract nor mechanism for making such decisions.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Validators and delegators on the Cosmos Hub can vote on proposals that can change preset parameters of the system automatically (such as the block gas limit), coordinate upgrades, as well as vote on amendments to a human-readible constitution that govern the policies of the Cosmos Hub. The constitution allows for cohesion among the stakeholders on issues regarding issues of theft and bugs (such as TheDAO incident), allowing for quicker and cleaner resolution.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Each zone can also have their own constitution and governance mechanism as well. For example, the Cosmos Hub could have a constitution that enforces immutability at the Hub (no roll-backs, save for bugs of the Cosmos Hub node implementation), while each zone can set their own policies regarding roll-backs in the case of theft and bugs.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">By enabling interoperability among differing policy zones, the Cosmos network gives the users ultimate freedom and potential for permissionless experimentation.</p> <h2 id=the-hub-and-zones _v-d057093e="">The Hub and Zones</h2> <p _v-d057093e="">Here we describe a novel model of decentralization and scalability. Cosmos is a network of many blockchains powered by Tendermint. While existing proposals aim to create a "single blockchain" with total global transaction ordering, Cosmos permits many blockchains to run concurrently with one another and yet retain interoperability.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">At the basis, the Cosmos Hub manages many independent blockchains called "zones" (sometimes referred to as "shards", in reference to the database scaling technique known as "sharding"). A constant stream of recent block commits from zones posted on the hub allows the hub to keep up with the state of each zone. Likewise, each zone keeps up with the state of the hub (but zones do not keep up with each other except indirectly through the hub). Packets of information are then communicated from one zone to another by posting Merkle-proofs as evidence that the information was sent and received. This mechanism is called inter-blockchain communication, or IBC for short.</p> <p _v-d057093e=""><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnuclear/atom-whitepaper/master/images/hub_and_zones.png alt="Figure of hub and zones\nacknowledgement" _v-d057093e=""></p> <p _v-d057093e="">Any of the zones can themselves be hubs to form an acyclic graph, but for the sake of clarity we will only describe the simple configuration where there is only one hub, and many non-hub zones.</p> <h3 id=the-hub _v-d057093e="">The Hub</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">The Cosmos Hub is a blockchain that hosts a multi-asset distributed ledger, where tokens can be held by individual users or by zones themselves. These tokens can be moved from one zone to another in a special IBC packet called a "coin packet". The hub is responsible for preserving the global invariance of the total amount of each token across the zones. IBC coin packet transactions must be committed by the sender, hub, and receiver blockchains.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Since the Cosmos Hub acts as a central ledger of tokens for the whole system, the security of the hub is of paramount importance. While each zone may be a Tendermint blockchain that is secured by as few as 4 (or even less if BFT consensus is not needed), the hub must be secured by a globally decentralized set of validators that can withstand the most severe attack scenarios, such as a continental network partition or a nation-state sponsored attack.</p> <h3 id=the-zones _v-d057093e="">The Zones</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">A Cosmos zone is an independent blockchain that exchanges IBC messages with the Hub. From the Hub\'s perspective, a zone is a multi-asset dynamic-membership multi-signature account that can send and receive tokens using IBC packets. Like a cryptocurrency account, a zone cannot transfer more tokens than it has, but can receive tokens from others who have them. A zone may be designated as an "source" of one or more token types, granting it the power to inflate that token supply.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Atoms of the Cosmos Hub may be staked by validators of a zone connected to the hub. While double-spend attacks on these zones would result in the slashing of atoms with Tendermint\'s fork-accountability, a zone where +⅔ of the voting power are Byzantine can commit invalid state. The Cosmos Hub does not verify or execute transactions committed on other zones, so it is the responsibility of users to send tokens to zones that they trust. In the future, the Cosmos Hub\'s governance system may pass Hub improvement proposals that account for zone failures. For example, outbound token transfers from some (or all) zones may be throttled to allow for the emergency circuit-breaking of zones (a temporary halt of token transfers) when an attack is detected.</p> <h2 id=inter-blockchain-communication-ibc- _v-d057093e="">Inter-blockchain Communication (IBC)</h2> <p _v-d057093e="">Now we look at how the hub and zones communicate with each other. Say that there are three blockchains, "Zone1", "Zone2", and "Hub", and we wish for "Zone1" to produce a packet destined for "Zone2" going through "Hub". For a packet to move from one blockchain to another, a proof is posted on the receiving chain that the sending chain published a packet for the alleged destination. For the receiving chain to check this proof, it must be able keep up with the sender\'s block headers. This mechanism is similar to that used by sidechains, requiring two interacting chains to "be aware" of one another via a bidirectional stream of proof-of-existence datagrams (transactions).</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The IBC protocol can naturally be defined using two types of transactions: an <code _v-d057093e="">IBCBlockCommitTx</code> transaction, which allows a blockchain to prove to any observer of its most recent block-hash, and an <code _v-d057093e="">IBCPacketTx</code> transaction, which allows a blockchain to prove to any observer that the given packet was indeed published by the sender\'s application via a Merkle-proof to the recent block-hash.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">By splitting the IBC mechanics into two separate transactions <code _v-d057093e="">IBCBlockCommitTx</code> and <code _v-d057093e="">IBCPacketTx</code>, we allow the native fee market-mechanism of the receiving chain to determine which packets get committed (i.e. acknowledged), while allowing for complete freedom on the sending chain as to how many outbound packets are allowed.</p> <p _v-d057093e=""><img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnuclear/atom-whitepaper/master/msc/ibc_without_ack.png alt="Figure of Zone1, Zone2, and Hub IBC without\nacknowledgement" _v-d057093e=""></p> <p _v-d057093e=""> In the example above, in order to update the block-hash of "Zone1" on "Hub" (or of "Hub" on "Zone2"), an <code _v-d057093e="">IBCBlockCommitTx</code> transaction must be posted on "Hub" with the block-hash of "Zone1" (or on "Zone2" with the block-hash of "Hub").</p> <p _v-d057093e=""><em _v-d057093e="">See <a href=#ibcblockcommittx _v-d057093e="">IBCBlockCommitTx</a> and <a href=#ibcpacketcommit _v-d057093e="">IBCPacketTx</a> for for more information on the two IBC transaction types.</em></p> <h2 id=use-cases _v-d057093e="">Use Cases</h2> <h3 id=pegging-to-other-cryptocurrencies _v-d057093e="">Pegging to Other Cryptocurrencies</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">A priveleged zone can act as the source of a pegged token of another cryptocurrency. A peg is in essence similar to the relationship between an Cosmos hub and zone; both must keep up with the latest blocks of the other in order to verify proofs that tokens have moved from one to the other. A peg-zone on the Cosmos network keeps up with both the hub as well as the other cryptocurrency. The indirection through the peg-zone allows the logic of the hub to remain simple and agnostic to other blockchain consensus strategies, like Bitcoin\'s proof-of-work mining.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">For instance, a Cosmos zone with some validator set, possibly the same as that of the hub, could act as an ether-peg, where the TMSP-application on the zone (the "peg-zone") has mechanisms to exchange IBC messages with a peg-contract on the external Ethereum blockchain (the "origin"). This contract would allow ether holders to send ether to the peg-zone by sending it to the peg-contract on Ethereum. Once ether is received by the peg-contract, the ether cannot be withdrawn unless an appropriate IBC packet is received by the peg-contract from the peg-zone. When a peg-zone receives an IBC packet proving that ether was received in the peg-contract for a particular Ethereum account, a corresponding account is created on the peg-zone with that balance. Ether on the peg-zone ("pegged-ether") can then be transferred to and from the hub, and later be destroyed with a transaction that sends it to a particular withdrawal address on Ethereum; an IBC packet proving that the transaction occured on the peg-zone can be posted to the Ethereum peg-contract to allow the ether to be withdrawn.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Of course, the risk of such a pegging contract is a rogue validator set. ⅓+ Byzantine voting power could cause a fork, withdrawing ether from the peg-contract on Ethereum while keeping the pegged-ether on the peg-zone. Worse, +⅔ Byzantine voting power can steal ether outright from those who sent it to the peg-contract by deviating from the original pegging logic of the peg-zone.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">It is possible to address these issues by designing the peg to be "totally accountable". For example, all IBC packets both from the hub as well as from the origin might require acknowledgement by the peg-zone in such a way that all state transitions of the peg-zone can be efficiently challenged and verified by either the hub or the origin\'s peg-contract. The hub and the origin should allow the peg-zone validators to post collateral, and token transfers out of the peg-contract should be delayed (and collateral unbonding period sufficiently long) to allow for any challenges to be made by independent auditors. We leave the design of the specification and implementation of this system open as a future Cosmos improvement proposal, to be passed by the Cosmos Hub\'s governance system.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">While the socio-political atmosphere is not quite evolved enough yet, we can extend the mechanism to allow for zones which peg to the fiat currency of a nation states by forming a validator set out of some combination of institutions responsible for the nation\'s currency, most particularly, its banks. Of course, extra precautions must be made to only accept currencies backed by strong legal systems that can enforce auditability of the banks\' activities by a sufficiently large group of trusted notaries and institutions.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">A result of this integration would be, for instance, the ability of anyone with a bank account at a participating bank to move dollars from their bank account, which is on the zone, to other accounts on the zone, or to the hub, or to another zone entirely. In this regard, the Cosmos Hub can act as a seamless conduit between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, removing the barriers that have until now limitted their interoperabiltiy to the realm of exchanges.</p> <h3 id=ethereum-scaling _v-d057093e="">Ethereum Scaling</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">An open issue for Ethereum is how to solve the scaling problem. Currently, Ethereum nodes process every single transaction and also stores all the state. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CjD0W4l4-CwHKUvfF5Vlps76fKLEC6pIwu1a_kC_YRQ/mobilepresent?slide=id.gd284b9333_0_28" _v-d057093e="">link</a>.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Since Tendermint can commit blocks much faster than Ethereum\'s proof-of-work, EVM zones powered by Tendermint consensus and operating on pegged-ether can provide higher performance to Ethereum blockchains. Additionally, though the Cosmos hub and IBC packet mechanics does not allow for arbitrary contract logic execution per se, it can be used to coordinate token movements between Ethereum contracts running on different zones, providing a foundation for token-centric Ethereum scaling via sharding.</p> <h3 id=multi-application-integration _v-d057093e="">Multi-Application Integration</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">Cosmos zones run arbitrary application logic, defined at the beginning of the zone\'s life, and potentially updated over time by governance. Such flexibility allows Cosmos zones to act as pegs to other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum or Bitcoin, but it also permits derivatives of those blockchains, utilizing the same codebase but with a different validator set and initial distribution. This allows many existing cryptocurrency frameworks, such as that of Ethereum, Zerocash, Bitcoin, CryptoNote, and so on to be used with a higher performance consensus engine (Tendermint Core) on a common network, openning tremendous opportunity for interoperability across platforms. Furthermore, as a multi-asset blockchain, a single transaction may contain multiple inputs and outputs, where each input can be any token type, enabling Cosmos to serve directly as a platform for decentralized exchange, though orders are assumed to be matched via other platforms. Alternatively, a zone can serve as a distributed fault-tolerant exchange (with orderbooks), which can be a strict improvement over existing centralized cryptocurrency exchanges which tend to get hacked over time. </p> <p _v-d057093e="">Zones can also serve as blockchain-backed versions of enterprise and government systems, where pieces of a particular service, traditionally run by an organization or group of organizations, are instead run as a TMSP application on a certain zone, allowing it to inherit the security and interoperability of the public Cosmos network, without sacrificing control over the underlying service. Thus, Cosmos may offer the best of both worlds for organizations looking to utilize blockchain technology that are wary of relinquishing control completely to a (distributed) third party.</p> <h3 id=network-partition-mitigation _v-d057093e="">Network Partition Mitigation</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">Some claim that a major problem with consistency-favouring consensus algorithms like Tendermint is that any network partition which causes there to be no single partition with +⅔ voting power (e.g. ⅓+ goign offline) will halt consensus altogether. The Cosmos architecture can mitigate this problem by using a global hub with regional autonomous zones, where voting power for each zone are distributed based on a common geographic region. For instance, a common paradigm may be for individual cities, or regions, to operate their own zones while sharing a common hub (e.g. the Cosmos Hub), enabling municipal activity to persist in the event that the hub halts due to a temporary network partition. Note that this allows real geological, political, and network-topological features to be considered in designing robust federated fault-tolerant systems.</p> <h3 id=federated-name-resolution-system _v-d057093e="">Federated Name Resolution System</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">NameCoin was one of the first blockchains to attempt to solve the name-resolution problem by adapting the Bitcoin blockchain. Unfortunately there have been several issues with this approach.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">With Namecoin, we can verify that say, <em _v-d057093e="">@satoshi</em> was registered with a particular public key at some point in the past, but we wouldn’t know whether the public key had since been updated recently unless we download all the blocks since the last update of that name. This is due to the limitation of Bitcoin\'s UTXO transaction Merkle-ization model where only the transactions (but not mutable application state) are Merkle-ized into the block-hash -- which lets us prove existence, but not the non-existence of later updates to a name. Thus, we can\'t know for certain the most recent value of a name without trusting a full node, or incurring significant costs in bandwidth by downloading the whole blockchain.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Even if a Merkle-ized search tree were implemented in NameCoin, its dependency on proof-of-work makes light client verification problematic. Light clients must download a complete copy of the headers for all blocks in the entire blockchain (or at least all the headers since the last update to a name). This means that the bandwidth requirements scale linearly with the amount of time <a href=https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security _v-d057093e="">[21]</a>. In addition, name-changes on a proof-of-work blockchain requires waiting for additional proof-of-work confirmation blocks, which can take up to an hour on Bitcoin.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">With Tendermint, all we need is the most recent block-hash signed by a quorum of validators (by voting power), and a Merkle proof to the current value associated with the name. This makes it possible to have a succinct, quick, and secure light-client verification of name values.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">In Cosmos, we can take this concept and extend it further. Each name-registration zone in Cosmos can have an associated top-level-domain (TLD) name such as ".com" or ".org", and each name-registration zone can have its own governance and registration rules.</p> <h2 id=issuance-and-incentives _v-d057093e="">Issuance and Incentives</h2> <h3 id=the-atom-token _v-d057093e="">The Atom Token</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">While the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native token called the <em _v-d057093e="">atom</em>. Atoms are the only staking token of the Cosmos Hub. Atoms are a license for the holder to vote, validate, or delegate to other validators. Like Ethereum\'s ether, atoms can also be used to pay for transaction fees to mitigate spam.

In that case, the transaction is only valid if the amount of atoms is greater than the amount of effective atoms held by the smallest validator, where effective atoms include delegated atoms. When a new validator replaces an existing validator in such a way, the existing validator becomes inactive and all the atoms and delegated atoms enter the unbonding state.</p> <h3 id=penalties-for-validators _v-d057093e="">Penalties for Validators</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">There must be some penalty imposed on the validators for when they intentionally or unintentionally deviate from the sanctioned protocol.

Such evidence will result in the validator losing its good standing and its bonded atoms as well its proportionate share of tokens in the reserve pool -- collectively called its "stake" -- will get slashed.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Sometimes, validators will not be available, either due to regional network disruptions, power failure, or other reasons. If, at any point in the past <code _v-d057093e="">ValidatorTimeoutWindow</code> blocks, a validator\'s commit vote is not included in the blockchain more than <code _v-d057093e="">ValidatorTimeoutMaxAbsent</code> times, that validator will become inactive, and lose <code _v-d057093e="">ValidatorTimeoutPenalty</code> (DEFAULT 1%) of its stake.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Some "malicious" behavior do not produce obviously discernable evidence on the blockchain.

This section provides a brief survey of a select number of important ones.</p> <h3 id=consensus-systems _v-d057093e="">Consensus Systems</h3> <h4 id=classic-byzantine-fault-tolerance _v-d057093e="">Classic Byzantine Fault Tolerance</h4> <p _v-d057093e="">Consensus in the presence of malicious participants is a problem dating back to the early 80s, when Leslie Lamport coined the phrase "Byzantine fault" to refer to arbitrary process behavior that deviates from the intended behavior, in contrast to a "crash fault", wherein a process simply crashes. Early solutions were discovered for synchronous networks where there is an upper bound on message latency, though pratical use was limited to highly controlled environments such as airplane controllers and datacenters synchronized via atomic clocks. It was not until the late 90s that Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) <a href=http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf _v-d057093e="">[11]</a> was introduced as an efficient partially synchronous consensus algorithm able to tolerate up to ⅓ of processes behaving arbitrarily. PBFT became the standard algorithm, spawning many variations, including most recently by IBM as part of their contribution to Hyperledger.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The main benefit of Tendermint consensus over PBFT is that Tendermint has an improved and simplified underlying structure, some of which is a result of embracing the blockchain paradigm. Tendermint blocks must commit in order, which obviates the complexity and communication overhead associated with PBFT\'s view-changes. In Cosmos and many cryptocurrencies, there is no need to allow for block <em _v-d057093e="">N+i</em> where <em _v-d057093e="">i &gt;= 1</em> to commit, when block <em _v-d057093e="">N</em> itself hasn\'t yet committed. If bandwidth is the reason why block <em _v-d057093e="">N</em> hasn\'t committed in a Cosmos zone, then it doesn\'t help to use bandwidth sharing votes for blocks <em _v-d057093e="">N+i</em>. If a network partition or offline nodes is the reason why block <em _v-d057093e="">N</em> hasn\'t committed, then <em _v-d057093e="">N+i</em> won\'t commit anyway.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">In addition, the batching of transactions into blocks allows for regular Merkle-hashing of the application state, rather than periodic digests as with PBFT\'s checkpointing scheme. This allows for faster provable transaction commits for light-clients and faster inter-blockchain communication.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Tendermint Core also includes many optimizations and features that go above and beyond what is specified in PBFT. For example, the blocks proposed by validators are split into parts, Merkle-ized, and gossipped in such a way that improves broadcasting performance (see LibSwift <a href=http://www.ds.ewi.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/pds/papers/PerformanceAnalysisOfLibswift.pdf _v-d057093e="">[19]</a> for inspiration). Also, Tendermint Core doesn\'t make any assumption about point-to-point connectivity, and functions for as long as the P2P network is weakly connected.</p> <h4 id=bitshares-delegated-stake _v-d057093e="">BitShares delegated stake</h4> <p _v-d057093e="">While not the first to deploy proof-of-stake (PoS), BitShares <a href=https://bitshares.org/technology/delegated-proof-of-stake-consensus/ _v-d057093e="">[12]</a> contributed considerably to research and adoption of PoS blockchains, particularly those known as "delegated" PoS. In BitShares, stake holders elect "witnesses", responsible for ordering and committing transactions, and "delegates", responsible for co-ordinating software updates and parameter changes. Though BitShares achieves high performance (100k tx/s, 1s latency) in ideal conditions, it is subject to double spend attacks by malicious witnesses which fork the blockchain without suffering an explicit economic punishment -- it suffers from the "nothing-at-stake" problem. BitShares attempts to mitigate the problem by allowing transactions to refer to recent block-hashes. Additionally, stakeholders can remove or replace misbehaving witnesses on a daily basis, though this does nothing to explicitly punish a double-spend attack that was successful.</p> <h4 id=stellar _v-d057093e="">Stellar</h4> <p _v-d057093e="">Building on an approach pioneered by Ripple, Stellar <a href=https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol.pdf _v-d057093e="">[13]</a> refined a model of Federated Byzantine Agreement wherein the processes participating in consensus do not constitute a fixed and globally known set. Rather, each process node curates one or more "quorum slices" each constituting a set of trusted processes. A "quorum" in Stellar is defined to be a set of nodes that contain (is a superset of) at least one quorum slice for each node in the set, such that agreement can be reached.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The security of the Stellar mechanism relies on the assumption that the intersection of <em _v-d057093e="">any</em> two quorums is non-empty, while the availability of a node requires at least one of its quorum slices to consist entirely of correct nodes, creating a trade-off between using large or small quorum-slices that may be difficult to balance without imposing significant assumptions about trust. Ultimately, nodes must somehow choose adequate quorum slices for there to be sufficient fault-tolerance (or any "intact nodes" at all, of which much of the results of the paper depend on), and the only provided strategy for ensuring such a configuration is heirarchical and similar to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), used by top-tier ISPs on the internet to establish global routing tables, and by that used by browsers to manage TLS certificates; both notorious for their insecurity.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The criticism in the Stellar paper of the Tendermint-based proof-of-stake systems is mitigated by the token strategy described here, wherein a new type of token called the <em _v-d057093e="">atom</em> is issued that represent claims to future portions of fees and rewards. The advantage of Tendermint-based proof-of-stake, then, is its relative simplicity, while still providing sufficient, and provable security guarantees.</p> <h4 id=bitcoinng _v-d057093e="">BitcoinNG</h4> <p _v-d057093e="">BitcoinNG is a proposed improvement to Bitcoin that would allow for forms of vertical scalability, such as increasing the block size, without the negative economic consequences typically associated with such a change, such as the disproportionately large impact on small miners. This improvement is achieved by separating leader election from transaction broadcast: leaders are first elected by proof-of-work in "micro-blocks", and then able to broadcast transactions to be committed until a new micro-block is found. This reduces the bandwidth requirements necessary to win the PoW race, allowing small miners to more fairly compete, and allowing transactions to be committed more regularly by the last miner to find a micro-block.</p> <h4 id=casper _v-d057093e="">Casper</h4> <p _v-d057093e="">Casper <a href=https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/ _v-d057093e="">[16]</a> is a proposed proof-of-stake consensus algorithm for Ethereum. Its prime mode of operation is "consensus-by-bet". The idea is that by letting validators iteratively bet on which block it believes will become committed into the blockchain based on the other bets that it\'s seen so far, finality can be achieved eventually. <a href=https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/12/28/understanding-serenity-part-2-casper/ _v-d057093e="">link</a>. This is an active area of research by the Casper team. The challenge is in constructing a betting mechanism that can be proven to be an evolutionarily stable strategy. The main benefit of Casper as compared to Tendermint may be in offering "availability over consistency" -- consensus does not require a +⅔ quorum of voting power -- perhaps at the cost of commit speed or implementation complexity.</p> <h3 id=horizontal-scaling _v-d057093e="">Horizontal Scaling</h3> <h4 id=interledger-protocol _v-d057093e="">Interledger Protocol</h4> <p _v-d057093e="">The Interledger protocol <a href=https://interledger.org/rfcs/0001-interledger-architecture/ _v-d057093e="">[14]</a> is not strictly a scalability solution. It provides an adhoc interoperation between different ledger systems through a loosely coupled bilateral relationship network. Like the Lightning Network, the purpose of ILP is to facilitate payments, but it specifically focuses on payments across disparate ledger types, and extends the atomic transaction mechanism to include not only hash-locks, but also a quroum of notaries (called the Atomic Transport Protocol). The latter mechanism for enforcing atomicity in inter-ledger transactions is similar to Tendermint\'s light-client SPV echanism, so an illustration of the distinction between ILP and Cosmos/IBC is warranted, and provided below.</p> <ol _v-d057093e=""> <li _v-d057093e=""><p _v-d057093e="">The notaries of a connector in ILP does not support membership changes, and does not allow for flexible weighting between notaries.

In a token transfer over IBC, the validator-set of the receiver\'s blockchain is responsible for providing confirmation, not the receiving user.</p> </li> <li _v-d057093e=""><p _v-d057093e="">The most striking difference is that ILP\'s connectors are not responsible or keeping authoritative state about payments, whereas in Cosmos, the validators of a hub are the authority of the state of IBC token transfers as well as the authority of the amount of tokens held by each zone (but not the amount of tokens held by each account within a zone). This is he fundamental innovation that allows for secure asymmetric tranfer of tokens from zone to zone; the analog to ILP\'s connector in Cosmos is a persistent and maximally secure blockchain ledger, the Cosmos Hub.</p> </li> <li _v-d057093e=""><p _v-d057093e="">The inter-ledger payments in ILP need to be backed by an exchange orderbook, as there is no asymmetric transfer of coins from one ledger to another, only the transfer of value or market equivalents.</p> </li> </ol> <h4 id=sidechains _v-d057093e="">Sidechains</h4> <p _v-d057093e="">Sidechains <a href=https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf _v-d057093e="">[15]</a> are a proposed mechanism for scaling the Bitcoin network via alternative blockchains that are "pegged" to the Bitcoin blockchain. Sidechains allow bitcoins to effectively move from the Bitcoin blockchain to the sidechain and back, and allow for experimentation in new features on the sidechain. As in the Cosmos Hub, the sidechain and Bitcoin serve as light-clients of each other, using SPV proofs to determine when coins should be transferred to the sidechain and back. Of course, since Bitcoin uses proof-of-work, sidechains centered around Bitcoin suffer from the many problems and risks of proof-of-work as a consensus mechanism. Furthermore, this is a Bitcoin-maximalist solution that doesn\'t natively support a variety of tokens and inter-zone network topology as Cosmos does. That said, the core mechanism of the two-way peg is in principle the same as that employed by the Cosmos network.</p> <h4 id=ethereum-scalability-efforts _v-d057093e="">Ethereum Scalability Efforts</h4> <p _v-d057093e="">Ethereum is currently researching a number of different strategies to shard the state of the Ethereum blockchain to address scalability needs. These efforts have the goal of maintaining the abstraction layer offered by the current Ethereum Virtual Machine across the shared state space. Multiple research efforts are underway at this time. <a href=https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/53 _v-d057093e="">[18]</a><a href=http://vitalik.ca/files/mauve_paper.html _v-d057093e="">[22]</a></p> <h5 id=cosmos-vs-ethereum-2-0-mauve _v-d057093e="">Cosmos vs Ethereum 2.0 Mauve</h5> <p _v-d057093e="">Cosmos and Ethereum 2.0 Mauve <a href=http://vitalik.ca/files/mauve_paper.html _v-d057093e="">[22]</a> have different design goals.</p> <ul _v-d057093e=""> <li _v-d057093e="">Cosmos is specifically about tokens.

This is made possible by on-chain cryptocurrency scripts, which enables parties to enter into bilateral stateful contracts where the state can be updated by sharing digital signatures, and contracts can be closed by finally publishing evidence onto the blockchain, a mechanism first popularized by cross-chain atomic swaps. By openning payment channels with many parties, participants in the Lightning Network can become focal points for routing the payments of others, leading to a fully connected payment channel network, at the cost of capital being tied up on payment channels.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">While the Lightning Network can also easily extend across multiple independent blockchains to allow for the transfer of <em _v-d057093e="">value</em> via an exchange market, it cannot be used to assymetrically transfer <em _v-d057093e="">tokens</em> from one blockchain to another. The main benefit of the Cosmos network described here is to enable such direct token transfers. That said, we expect payment channels and the Lightning Network to become widely adopted along with our token transfer mechanism, for cost-saving and privacy reasons.</p> <h4 id=segregated-witness _v-d057093e="">Segregated Witness</h4> <p _v-d057093e="">Segregated Witness is a Bitcoin improvement proposal <a href=https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki _v-d057093e="">link</a> that aims to increase the per-block tranasction throughput 2X or 3X, while simultaneously making block syncing faster for new nodes. The brilliance of this solution is in how it works within the limitations of Bitcoin\'s current protocol and allows for a soft-fork upgrade (i.e. clients with older versions of the software will continue to function after the upgrade). Tendermint being a new protocol has no design restrictions, so it has a different scaling priorities. Primarily, Tendermint uses a BFT round-robin algorithm based on cryptographic signatures instead of mining, which trivially allows horizontal scaling through multiple parallel blockchains, while regular, more frequent block commits allow for vertical scaling as well.</p> <hr _v-d057093e=""> <h2 id=appendix _v-d057093e="">Appendix</h2> <h3 id=fork-accountability _v-d057093e="">Fork Accountability</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">A well designed consensus protocol should provide some guarantees in the event that the tolerance capacity is exceeded and the consensus fails. This is especially necessary in economic systems, where Byzantine behaviour can have substantial financial reward. The most important such guarantee is a form of <em _v-d057093e="">fork-accountability</em>, where the processes that caused the consensus to fail (ie. caused clients of the protocol to accept different values - a fork) can be identified and punished according to the rules of the protocol, or, possibly, the legal system. When the legal system is unreliable or excessively expensive to invoke, validators can be forced to make security deposits in order to participate, and those deposits can be revoked, or slashed, when malicious behaviour is detected <a href=https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/ _v-d057093e="">[10]</a>.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Note this is much unlike Bitcoin, where forking is a regular occurence due to network asynchrony and the probabilistic nature of finding partial hash collissions. Since in many cases, a malicious fork is indistinguishable from a fork due to asynchrony, Bitcoin can not reliably implement fork-accountability, other than the implicit opportunity cost paid by miners for mining an orphaned block.</p> <h3 id=tendermint-consensus _v-d057093e="">Tendermint Consensus</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">We call the voting stages <em _v-d057093e="">PreVote</em> and <em _v-d057093e="">PreCommit</em>. A vote can be for a particular block or for <em _v-d057093e="">Nil</em>. We call a collection of +⅔ PreVotes for a single block in the same round a <em _v-d057093e="">Polka</em>, and a collection of +⅔ PreCommits for a single block in the same round a <em _v-d057093e="">Commit</em>. If +⅔ PreCommit for Nil in the same round, they move to the next round.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Note that strict determinism in the protocol incurs a weak synchrony assumption as faulty leaders must be detected and skipped. Thus, validators wait some amount of time <em _v-d057093e="">TimeoutPropose</em> before they Prevote Nil, and the value of TimeoutPropose increases with each round. Progression through the rest of a round is fully asychronous, in that progress is only made once a validator hears from +⅔ of the network. In practice, it would take an extremely strong adversary to indefinetely thwart the weak synchrony assumption (causing the consensus to fail to ever commit a block), and doing so can be made even more difficult by using randomized values of TimeoutPropose on each validator.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">An additional set of constraints, or Locking Rules, ensure that the network will eventually commit just one block at each height. Any malicious attempt to cause more than one block to be committed at a given height can be identified. First, a PreCommit for a block must come with justification, in the form of a Polka for that block. If the validator has already PreCommit a block at round <em _v-d057093e="">R_1</em>, we say they are <em _v-d057093e="">locked</em> on that block, and the Polka used to justify the new PreCommit at round <em _v-d057093e="">R_2</em> must come in a round <em _v-d057093e="">R_polka</em> where <em _v-d057093e="">R_1 &lt; R_polka &lt;= R_2</em>. Second, validators must Propose and/or PreVote the block they are locked on. Together, these conditions ensure that a validator does not PreCommit without sufficient evidence as justification, and that validators which have already PreCommit cannot contribute to evidence to PreCommit something else. This ensures both safety and liveness of the consensus algorithm.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The full details of the protocol are described <a href=https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Byzantine-Consensus-Algorithm _v-d057093e="">here</a>.</p> <h3 id=tendermint-light-clients _v-d057093e="">Tendermint Light Clients</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">The need to sync all block headers is eliminated in Tendermint-PoS as the existence of an alternative chain (a fork) means ⅓+ of bonded stake can be slashed. Of course, since slashing requires that <em _v-d057093e="">someone</em> share evidence of a fork, light clients should store any block-hash commits that it sees. Additionally, light clients could periodically stay synced with changes to the validator set, in order to avoid <a href=#preventing-long-range-attacks _v-d057093e="">long range attacks</a> (but other solutions are possible).</p> <p _v-d057093e="">In spirit similar to Ethereum, Tendermint enables applications to embed a global Merkle root hash in each block, allowing easily verifiable state queries for things like account balances, the value stored in a contract, or the existence of an unspent transaction output, depending on the nature of the application.</p> <h3 id=preventing-long-range-attacks _v-d057093e="">Preventing Long Range Attacks</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">Assuming a sufficiently resilient collection of broadcast networks and a static validator set, any fork in the blockchain can be detected and the deposits of the offending validators slashed. This innovation, first suggested by Vitalik Buterin in early 2014, solves the nothing-at-stake problem of other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies (see <a href=#related-work _v-d057093e="">Related Work</a>). However, since validator sets must be able to change, over a long range of time the original validators may all become unbonded, and hence would be free to create a new chain, from the genesis block, incurring no cost as they no longer have deposits locked up. This attack came to be known as the Long Range Attack (LRA) in contrast to a Short Range Attack, where validators who are currently bonded cause a fork and are hence punishable (assuming a fork-accountable BFT algorithm like Tendermint consensus). Long Range Attacks are often thought to be a critical blow to proof-of-stake.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Fortunately, the LRA can be mitigated as follows. First, for a validator to unbond (thereby recovering their collateral deposit and no longer earning fees to participate in the consensus), the deposit must be made untransferable for an amount of time known as the "unbonding period", which may be on the order of weeks or months. Second, for a light client to be secure, the first time it connects to the network it must verify a recent block-hash against a trusted source, or preferably multiple of them. This condition is sometimes referred to as "weak subjectivity". Finally, to remain secure, it must sync up with the latest validator set at least as frequently as the length of the unbonding period. This ensures that the light client knows about changes to the validator set before a validator has its capital unbonded and thus no longer at stake, which would allow it to deceive the client by carrying out a long range attack by creating new blocks beginning back at a height where it was bonded (assuming it has control of sufficiently many of the early private keys).</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Note that overcoming the LRA in this way requires an overhaul of the original security model of proof-of-work. In PoW, it is assumed that a light client can sync to the current height from the trusted genesis block at any time simply by processing the proof-of-work in every block header. To overcome the LRA, however, we require that a light client come online with some regularity to track changes in the validator set, and that the first time they come online they must be particularly careful to authenticate what they hear from the network against trusted sources. Of course, this latter requirement is similar to that of Bitcoin, where the protocol and software must also be obtained from a trusted source.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The above method for preventing LRA is well suited for validators and full nodes of a Tendermint-powered blockchain because these nodes are meant to remain connected to the network. The method is also suitable for light clients that can be expected to sync with the network frequently. However, for light clients that are not expected to have frequent access to the internet or the blockchain network, yet another solution can be used to overcome the LRA. Non-validator token holders can post their tokens as collateral with a very long unbonding period (e.g. much longer than the unbonding period for validators) and serve light clients with a secondary method of attesting to the validity of current and past block-hashes. While these tokens do not count toward the security of the blockchain\'s consensus, they nevertheless can provide strong guarantees for light clients. If historical block-hash querying were supported in Ethereum, anyone could bond their tokens in a specially designed smart contract and provide attestation services for pay, effectively creating a market for light-client LRA security.</p> <h3 id=overcoming-forks-and-censorship-attacks _v-d057093e="">Overcoming Forks and Censorship Attacks</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">Due to the definition of a block commit, any ⅓+ coalition of voting power can halt the blockchain by going offline or not broadcasting their votes. Such a coalition can also censor particular transactions by rejecting blocks that include these transactions, though this would result in a significant proportion of block proposals to be rejected, which would slow down the rate of block commits of the blockchain, reducing its utility and value. The malicious coalition might also broadcast votes in a trickle so as to grind blockchain block commits to a near halt, or engage in any combination of these attacks. Finally, it can cause the blockchain to fork, by double-signing or violating the locking rules.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">If a global active adversary were also involved, it can partition the network in such a way that it may appear that the wrong subset of validators were responsible for the slowdown. This is not just a limitation of Tendermint, but rather a limitation of all consensus protocols whose network is potentially controlled by an active adversary.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">For these types of attacks, a subset of the validators should coordinate through external means to sign a reorg-proposal that chooses a fork (and any evidence thereof) and the initial subset of validators with their signatures. Validators who sign such a reorg-proposal forego their collateral on all other forks. Clients should verify the signatures on the reorg-proposal, verify any evidence, and make a judgement or prompt the end-user for a decision. For example, a phone wallet app may prompt the user with a security warning, while a refrigerator may accept any reorg-proposal signed by +½ of the original validators by voting power.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">No non-synchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm can come to consensus when ⅓+ of voting power are dishonest, yet a fork assumes that ⅓+ of voting power have already been dishonest by double-signing or lock-changing without justification. So, signing the reorg-proposal is a coordination problem that cannot be solved by any non-synchronous protocol (i.e. automatically, and without making assumptions about the reliability of the underlying network). For now, we leave the problem of reorg-proposal coordination to human coordination via social consensus on internet media. Validators must take care to ensure that there are no remaining network partitions prior to signing a reorg-proposal, to avoid situations where two conflicting reorg-proposals are signed.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">Assuming that the external coordination medium and protocol is robust, it follows that forks are less of a concern than censorship attacks.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">In addition to forks and censorship, which require ⅓+ Byzantine voting power, a coalition of +⅔ voting power may commit arbitrary, invalid state. This is characteristic of any (BFT) consensus system. Unlike double-signing, which creates forks with easily verifiable evidence, detecting committment of an invalid state requires non-validating peers to verify whole blocks, which implies that they keep a local copy of the state and execute each transaction, computing the state root independently for themselves. Once detected, the only way to handle such a failure is via social consensus. For instance, in situations where Bitcoin has failed, whether forking due to software bugs (as in March 2013), or committing invalid state due to Byzantine behavior of miners (as in July 2015), the well connected community of businesses, developers, miners, and other organizations established a social consensus as to what manual actions were required by participants to heal the network. Furthermore, since validators of a Tendermint blockchain may be expected to be identifiable, commitment of an invalid state may even be punishable by law or some external jurisprudence, if desired.</p> <h3 id=tmsp-specification _v-d057093e="">TMSP specification</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">TMSP consists of 3 primary message types that get delivered from the core to the application.

The tree is balanced using a variant of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree _v-d057093e="">AVL algortihm</a>, and all operations are O(log(n)).</p> <p _v-d057093e="">In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. Whenever this condition is violated upon an update, the tree is rebalanced by creating O(log(n)) new nodes that point to unmodified nodes of the old tree. In the original AVL algorithm, inner nodes can also hold key-value pairs. The AVL+ algorithm (note the plus) modifies the AVL algorithm to keep all values on leaf nodes, while only using branch-nodes to store keys. This simplifies the algorithm while keeping the merkle hash trail short.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The AVL+ Tree is analogous to Ethereum\'s <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree _v-d057093e="">Patricia tries</a>. There are tradeoffs. Keys do not need to be hashed prior to insertion in IAVL+ trees, so this provides faster ordered iteration in the key space which may benefit some applications. The logic is simpler to implement, requiring only two types of nodes -- inner nodes and leaf nodes. The Merkle proof is on average shorter, being a balanced binary tree. On the other hand, the Merkle root of an IAVL+ tree depends on the order of updates.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">We will support additional efficient Merkle trees, such as Ethereum\'s Patricia Trie when the binary variant becomes available.</p> <h3 id=transaction-types _v-d057093e="">Transaction Types</h3> <p _v-d057093e="">In the canonical implementation, transactions are streamed to the Cosmos hub application via the TMSP interface.</p> <p _v-d057093e="">The Cosmos Hub will accept a number of primary transaction types, including <code _v-d057093e="">SendTx</code>, <code _v-d057093e="">BondTx</code>, <code _v-d057093e="">UnbondTx</code>, <code _v-d057093e="">ReportHackTx</code>, <code _v-d057093e="">SlashTx</code>, <code _v-d057093e="">BurnAtomTx</code>, <code _v-d057093e="">ProposalCreateTx</code>, and <code _v-d057093e="">ProposalVoteTx</code>, which are fairly self-explanatory and will be documented in a future revision of this paper.
