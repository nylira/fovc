# Family Office Venture Capital

This is the design mockup for the Family Office Venture Capital site. It's written in purely HTML and CSS, and the layouts work in both mobile devices and PCs.

## The Demo

You can view a demo of these pages at [nylira.github.io](https://nylira.github.io/).

The demo defaults to the Login page. You can click `Forgot Password` to get to the Forgotten Password page. You can fill out the Login form with anything and press `Login` to get the Companies page. You can also get to the Companies page or Account page just by clicking on the header.

You'll notice there are some validations in place for the Login, Forgot Password, and the Register form. It'll prevent users from submitting empty forms.

Note: You can get to Register page in the header. I realize this doesn't belong on the live version of the site. It's supposed to be a private link for you to send it. I've made it public for easier demoing. You can hide or delete this link.

## File Contents

There are six HTML pages included:

1. `index.html` - This is the Login page.
2. `forgot.html` - This is the Forgotten Password page.
3. `register.html` - This is the New Account page that you can send out privately.
4. `account.html` - This is the Account settings page for a user.
5. `companies.html` - This is the Company List page.
6. `company.html` - This is the individual page for a company.

All the CSS resides in `./css/screen.css`.

It's all ready for John Wm to integrate into the real app.

Feel free to message me at peng@nylira.com if you have any questions about the implementation.
